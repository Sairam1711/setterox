            <strong>B. PROVISION OF THE APP</strong>
             <ul className='f-w-200'>
              <li>
                Section 12 of the Public Gambling Act, 1867 provides that games of mere skill are exempt from the application of the Act. The Supreme Court of India and various High Courts have opined that a game of mere skill is one where success depends primarily on the player's knowledge, training, attention, experience, and skill, rather than luck.
              </li>
              <li>
                Users must note that the 'Ludo' game on our platform is a game of skill under Indian law. We do not support or offer games of chance for money.
              </li>
              <li>
                We prohibit individuals from states like Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Nagaland, Odisha, Telangana, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, and from outside India, from participating in the games. Access is banned for users from these regions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Game rules are clearly defined on the platform. Users are encouraged to read, understand, and follow them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Games on the platform are based on skill. Players' performance and actions directly impact the game outcome.
              </li>
              <li>
                While elements of chance exist in every game to add excitement, the game outcome depends largely on the playerâ€™s skill.
              </li>
              <li>
                Performance can improve with practice, as skills may enhance over time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Some games may have pre-determined outcomes, but these are achievable through skill.
              </li>
